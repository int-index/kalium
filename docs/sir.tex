\maketitle

\emph{Sodium} defines several internal (intermediate) representations. Thus
translation can be split into simpler steps: parsing, source conversion,
atomization, vectorization, target conversion, and rendering. The intermediate
representations between source and target conversions are called internal and
their specifications are provided in this document.

\section { The Scalar Representation }

The scalar representation comes in two flavors: non-atomic and atomic.
Translation of the former to the latter is called \emph{atomization}. The only
difference between the two is that in the atomic scalar representation
every expression is atomic, whereas in the non-atomic one some are not.

\subsection { Program Structure }

\begin {description}

\item [Program] is a set of functions, every function is uniquely identified by
its name.

\item [Function] is the main unit of abstraction. It represents an action
parametrized by values. This action also has a result --- the return value of
the function. Calling a function is providing it with some values, one for each
parameter, performing the action, and receiving the return value.

Thus, a function has a parameter list that declares what values can influence
the action and a body that defines this action. A parameter is basically a
variable declaration, annotated by a passing mechanism. The body consists of a
statement and an atomic expression that defines the return value.

That is, a function consists of a parameter list, local variables, and a body.
Their precise scoping relation is described in another section. A function is
also annotated by the type of its return value.

\item [Variable declaration] is a simple pair. The first element is the name
of a variable, and the second element is its type.

\item [Function signature] describes how a function can be called. It contains
the types and passing mechanisms of parameters, and the type of the return
value. Function signature can be unambigously derived from the definition of a
function.

\item [Statement] is the main unit of execution. It represents an action to be
performed at runtime. A statement can contain expressions, variable declarations
and other statements. Inside a statement, variables can be accessed and
functions can be called. Different statements capture different execution
semantics.

\item [Statement \emph{exec}] calls a function with some specific values. It
optionally binds the return value to a variable. Thus, it consists of a name of
the function to be called, a list of arguments, and an optional variable name.
An argument is an expression which is evaluated in order to provide a function
with a value of its parameter. The arguments are evaluated left-to-right before
the call.

\item [Statement \emph{if}] performs one action or another, dependening on the
value of a condition. Thus, it consists of a boolean expression and two
statements. It evaluates the condition, and if its value is \texttt{true}, then
it executes the first statement, otherwise the value is \texttt{false} and the
second statement is executed.

\item [Statement \emph{for}] traverses a list of values, performing an action
for each. It consists of a variable name (an iterator), a list expression and a
statement. The following steps are performed:
\begin {enumerate}
\item Consider the whole list to be the remaining list;
\item If the remaining list is empty---stop, otherwise proceed;
\item Copy the value of the list head to the iterator;
\item Execute the statement;
\item Consider the list tail to be the remaining list;
\item Goto step 2.
\end {enumerate}
The value of the iterator is undefined after the statement \emph{for}.

\item [Statement \emph{group}] sequentially executes multiple statements. It
consists of a list of statements. There are basically three possible cases:
\begin {enumerate}
\item The list is empty. In this case, no action is performed.
\item The list has one statement. The group is operationally indistinguishable
from this statement.
\item The list has multiple statements. They are executed one at a time.
\end {enumerate}

\item [Statement \emph{scope}] introduces new variables for another statement.
The structure that contains those variables can be arbitrary.

\item [Expression] can be atomic or non-atomic. In the former case, it's either
variable access or a literal. In the latter case, it can also be a function
call, which is replaced by the return value during evaluation.

\item [Literal] represents a value of a certain type. It is stored in a form
that allows easy analysis and manipulation.

\end {description}

\subsection { Scoping Rules }

A scope captures the scoping relation between two structures. The first one
introduces variables, and the second one can access them. Thus a set of variable
declarations should be derivable from the first structure.

\subsubsection { Scoping in a Function }

Parameter list creates a scope where a variable per parameter is introduced.
Inside there's another scope, created by local variables, that contains the
body. Thus, parameters are shadowed by local variables, and the the body has
access to both of them.

\subsubsection { Scoping in a Statement }

Statement \emph{scope} creates a scope. The variables it introduces do not exist
outside the statement, and inside the statement they can shadow the existing
ones. The value of an introduced variable is undefined.

\subsubsection { Name Shadowing }

When a scope introduces a variable with a name that was already introduced, it
is called name shadowing. The new variable is used instead the old one inside
the scope. They both exist independently, but the old variable is not visible.
